ArduScan
Sept 2011 by Bill Westfield ("WestfW")

Scan a windows system and try to figure out which COM ports
look like they might be Arduinos.

This is based on the article here:
  http://www.codeproject.com/KB/system/serial_portsenum_fifo.aspx
by Vladimir Afanasyev, which explains how to use the device manager
API to enumerate all the COM ports on a system, and
these forum entries:

  http://www.microchip.com/forums/tm.aspx?high=&m=364903&mpage=1#365029
Which explain how to get the USB Vendor/Product info from the same api.

Currently this is set up to run in a CMD or other shell window, and
writes its findings to stdout.


It should compile fine under cygwin, including mingw versions:

  g++ -mno-cygwin ArduScan.cpp -lsetupapi -o ArduScan.exe
